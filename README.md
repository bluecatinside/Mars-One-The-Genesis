# Purpose

To provide access to community created works. Such works were originally created for the purposes of being used in a software simulation, one for modelling and interactivity. Note the use of the Attribution 3.0 License. Please attribute works to Mars One's "Genesis" (a Mars colony simulation project) whenever there are no other attribution instructions found in "Concept" and "Production" folders.

# Concept

Concepts are intellectual property and attribution is necessary. They are also great to share and you never know what feedback you will get. Some models or scenes are very simple but very relevant to this project. 

# Production

Completed works, for this project, work with a number of graphics engines. Ensuring models are fit for purpose, even when the simulation software is as varied as working in the browser or working on an Android tablet, requires a minimum of 3 files be produced. Files include:

* .FBX file that, when imported into Unity, works as expected.

* .BLEND file that is the equivalent of the .FBX file.

* .BLEND file that abstractly shows 3D models as NURBS data.

* Any file dependencies.
